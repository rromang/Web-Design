            <p> The graph shows how the temperatures distribute according to its geographical location.
            </p>

            <p> The data points distribution assumes a bell shape with the highest temperatures located near latitude 20,
                northernmost and southernmost latitudes showing the lowest temperatures as expected. The data presented here shows expected
                distribution of the data points given the date the sample was collected. Being summer in the northern hemisphere, the max point of
                distribution was located near latitude 20.
            </p>

            <p>
                Of note, there are ~9 data points which represent sampled cities which had very high temperatures (>100ÂºF) that day which is very obvious
                in the graph visualization.
